Loan Default Risk Prediction using Machine Learning
Overview

This project focuses on predicting loan default risk using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop and evaluate classification models that can identify whether a borrower is likely to default on a loan based on financial and credit-related features.

This project was completed as part of a Machine Learning course and demonstrates practical skills in data preprocessing, model development, and performance evaluation.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is based on the Lending Club dataset, which includes borrower information such as:

Credit score

Loan amount

Financial history

Outstanding principal balance

Other financial indicators

Technologies Used

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

Google Colab

Machine Learning Models

The following models were implemented and evaluated:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

K-Means Clustering

Logistic Regression achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 99.5%.

Project Workflow
